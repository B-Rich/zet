> ZET BIOS for ALTERA-DE1 board <

In order to build the BIOS, you can do it in Windows or Linux. You need the
Open Watcom 16-bit compiler installed (with DOS libraries). In Linux, you
need also native GCC installed.

To build the BIOS:
Linux:   ./b.sh
Windows: b.bat

To clean all files:
Linux:   ./c.sh
Windows: c.bat

The resulting file is "bios.rom" with exactly 128Kb in size (VGABIOS + ZETBIOS)
