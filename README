Quick help
----------
The most important file is "boards/xilinx-ml403/rtl/kotku.v" for the
Xilinx ML403 board, or "boards/altera-de1/rtl/kotku.v" for the Altera
DE1 board, as this is the top level module for the complete SOC system. 

=== Xilinx ML403 ===
For building the system for the Xilinx ML403 board,
 (Xilinx tools must be installed):
$ source /opt/Xilinx/10.1/ISE/settings64.sh  # (or equivalent)
$ cd boards/xilinx-ml403/syn/
$ make

As a result, you will have a file named "kotku.bit", which is the conf-
iguration stream for the FPGA.

=== Altera DE1 ===
To build the system for the Altera DE1 board, just open the file
"boards/altera-de1/syn/kotku.qpf" in Quartus II and compile the system.

As a result, you will have a file named "kotku.sof", which is the conf-
iguration stream for the FPGA.

Explanation of directories
--------------------------
bin/    - Some scripts to prepare ROMs, download microcode, etc...
doc/    - Documentation stub
boards/ - Different boards supported (implementation dependent files)
cores/  - Different cores for the SOC PC system
cores/zet/ - Zet processor RTL code
src/    - Source files for some commands used to transform ROMs
src/bios/ - ROM BIOS and VIDEO BIOS implementation
tests/  - 8086 test benches (exactly the same as in the web)
